       You are creating a presentation page for a restaurant.
       The restaurant website will include a carousel with some pictures, a jumbotron with a catchy slogan and a reservation form.
​
       In the reservation form, the user can select:
​
       - Name
       - Phone number
       - Number of persons
       - Smoking (true / false)
       - Date and Time
       - Special Requests
​
       These reservation will be sent to the owner of the restaurant trough a REST API.
​
       https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/reservation/
​
       The API accepts JSON as content payload and provides the usual REST features:
​
       - GET https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/reservation/ ==> Fetch all the reservations
       - GET https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/reservation/{id} ==> Fetch a single reservation
       - POST https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/reservation/ ==> Submit a new reservation
       - PUT https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/reservation/{id} ==> Edit a single reservation
       - DELETE https://striveschool.herokuapp.com/api/reservation/{id} ==> Delete a single reservation
​
       [EXTRA]
       Create a "back office" page where the restaurants' manager can edit / delete / check reservations.
